/**
 * A panel that hangs off a trigger and is rendered at the end of the page, whoever decides when it
 * is open.
 *
 * <p>Rendering it at the body is what keeps it whole: a panel positioned beside its trigger is cut
 * off by every ancestor with `overflow`, a text field, a block of the page editor or the body of a
 * dialog alike. It is placed against the element this component renders around the trigger, which
 * may also be an empty point, such as the cursor of a text editor.
 *
 * <p>A press outside the trigger and the panel, and the escape key, close it and are reported as
 * `dismissed`; a press inside leaves it alone. Focus leaving both is reported as `focusLeft`.
 *
 * <p>It works inside a dialog as well. The panel paints above every dialog layer and takes the
 * pointer although a dialog has switched it off for the rest of the page. While it is open it
 * holds a focus scope of its own, which pauses the dialog's trap, so its fields can take the focus.
 * `opened` is emitted once that scope stands and the panel is placed, which is the moment a caller
 * can move the focus into it; the panel moves none itself, so an editor keeps its selection.
