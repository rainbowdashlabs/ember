/**
 * A panel that hangs off a trigger and opens and closes itself: a row's menu, a table's column list.
 *
 * <p>The panel is a {@link FloatingPanel}, rendered at the body rather than beside its trigger,
 * because a trigger usually sits in something that scrolls, and a panel positioned inside a table
 * with `overflow-x-auto` is cut off at the edge of the table.
 *
 * <p>Standing at the end of the body is also why focus is moved by hand. Tabbing on from the
 * trigger would otherwise walk the whole rest of the page before arriving at the panel that just
 * opened, so the first control in it is focused on open and the trigger gets its focus back on
 * close. The panel is placed before that focus lands, so it is no longer transparent by then.
 *
 * <p>It closes on a press outside, on escape, and when focus is tabbed out of it. A menu also
 * closes once something in it was chosen; a panel of settings, such as a column list, stays open
 * while the reader ticks through it.
 *
 * <p>The trigger comes in through the `trigger` slot, which is handed `toggle`, `open` and the
 * attributes that tie the trigger to its panel. The content is handed `close`, for a dialog that is
 * done once something deeper in it was chosen.
