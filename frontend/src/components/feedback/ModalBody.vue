/**
 * The scrolling body of a dialog, which also names the dialog after its own heading.
 *
 * <p>A dialog's title is the first heading its content brings along, since every dialog here opens
 * with one. That heading is what the dialog is labelled by, so a screen reader announces it on
 * open. A heading without an id of its own takes the one the dialog already points at; a heading
 * that has one is pointed at instead, and a dialog without any heading is left unlabelled rather
 * than pointing at nothing.
 *
 * <p>The link is made as the content mounts, which is before the dialog itself finishes mounting,
 * so the dialog finds its title in place the moment it looks for one.
