/**
 * A row of buttons that becomes a column where a phone cannot hold it.
 *
 * <p>Several buttons on one narrow line run out of room, and each one then breaks its own label onto
 * a second line. The row ends up holding buttons of two different heights with whatever space is
 * left between them. Below the breakpoint this lays them out as a grid instead, so a button takes
 * the width of its column rather than the width of its words: alone on a line that is the full
 * width, and sharing one they are equal. From the breakpoint up it is the plain flex row it looks
 * like, with every button at its natural width.
 *
 * <p>Whether two short buttons share a mobile line is the caller's to say, because the length of a
 * label is not something this can measure. Stacking is the safe answer and the default.
