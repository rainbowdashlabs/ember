 * The panel every dropdown opens: hung off its trigger, and rendered at the end of the page.
 *
 * <p>Rendering it there is what keeps a dropdown in a table whole. A panel placed beside its
 * trigger is cut off by every ancestor that scrolls, and a table with `overflow-x-auto` is one. It
 * is placed under the trigger, or above it where there is no room below, and follows it as the page
 * scrolls.
 *
 * <p>Opening moves the focus into the panel and closing gives it back to the trigger. Escape, a
 * press outside and tabbing away all close it. Nothing listens to the page while it is closed, so
 * a screen full of closed dropdowns costs nothing and renders on the server as it is.
 *
 * <p>The trigger comes in through the `trigger` slot and must be a single element or component,
 * which receives the attributes that tie it to the panel.
