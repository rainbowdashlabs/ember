/**
 * Where a panel that hangs off a button goes, once it has left the layout to get there.
 *
 * <p>A panel positioned inside its own corner of the page is at the mercy of every ancestor: one
 * with `overflow` clips it, and the reader is left scrolling a table sideways to read a menu. The
 * way out is to render it at the body and place it by hand, which is what this works out: hanging
 * under the button and aligned to one of its edges, flipped above when there is no room below, and
 * never past the edge of the window.
 *
 * <p>The placement is redone while the panel is open, because everything it was measured against
 * can move: the page scrolls, a pane scrolls, the window is resized.
 *
 * <p>A panel has to be in the document before it can be measured, so for one frame it stands at
 * the top left of the window. It is therefore held transparent until it has been placed, which is
 * the difference between a menu that appears where it belongs and one that flashes in the corner
 * first. Transparent rather than hidden, because a hidden element cannot take focus, and the menu
 * hands focus to its first entry the moment it opens.
 *
 * <p>A panel that is already showing when it mounts is placed as well, not only one that opens
 * later.
 *
 * @param anchor the element the panel belongs to, whose rectangle it is placed against
 * @param open   whether the panel is showing
 * @param align  which edge of the anchor the panel lines up with, the right one unless told otherwise
