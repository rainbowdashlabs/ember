 * Closes a panel when the reader presses somewhere outside it or presses escape.
 *
 * <p>It listens for the pointer going down, not for a click. Plenty of the page stops its clicks
 * from travelling on (a row menu's trigger, a header's filter icon, the cells of a clickable row),
 * and a panel waiting for a click to reach the document would stay open over every one of them.
 * The pointer going down reaches the document before any of those handlers run.
 *
 * <p>The listeners are only there while the panel is open, so a page full of closed menus costs
 * nothing. A closed panel never touches the document at all, which is what lets a page holding one
 * be rendered on the server, where there is no document.
 *
 * @param open      whether the panel is showing
 * @param regions   the elements that count as inside: usually the trigger and the panel, which is
 *                  often rendered elsewhere in the document than its trigger
 * @param onDismiss called once per press outside or escape while open
